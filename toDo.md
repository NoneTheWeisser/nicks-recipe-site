# Future Ideas:
- Automate the recipe page creation using JSON
- Could add reviews (stars) to the thumbnails 
- Nav bar overhaul:
    - Catergories 
    - Search bar
    - login screen
        - favorite option
- feature where you could submit a recipe and the page is created. 
    - Would really need to figure out if there are any security issues doing that.
