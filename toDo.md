# Future Ideas:
- Automate the recipe page creation using JSON
- Could add reviews (stars) to the thumbnails 
- Nav bar overhaul:
    - Categories 
    - do we need a logo or something in the middle of the bar? 
    - be nice to get more images from cooking
    - Search bar
    - login screen
        - favorite option
- feature where you could submit a recipe and the page is created. 
    - Would really need to figure out if there are any security issues doing that.
- How do we handle the recipe cards on the font?
    - should we lock in a grid? 
    - are there cooler ways to display? 
    - gallery sliders?


# for app?
- as a user you can create/save your own recipe book. Fill out form to add recipe and it will create and everything for you.
- probably would need to have templates they could choose from? 
    - or just ability to change colors?
